                <p class=>Notes and Tasks undertaken 

                   <li> 9.45- Standup meeting</li>
                    
                    <li>Use VPN in order to secure and do internal jobs </li>
                    
                 <li> 7 developers and 3 testing managers</li>
                    
                   <li> Starting up Broker service & failing - the URL wasn’t updated ?? </li>
                    
                    **FIXED**
                    
                   <li> Different Jobs assigned - Stories and Defects - Microsoft's ADO
                    Everyone has similar abilities within the company</li>
                    
                    Starts from Product Owner- Decides what he wants in the sprint and writes stories/tasks and then passed to lead developer, programmers and testers and they estimate how long it will take them. 
                    
                    <li>Development - Implementation - PR/Testing </li>
                    
                   <li> Branches for programming and it’s all eventually compiled into one place for all of the code so that separate developers can work on subsystems and once tested, it can all come together.</li>
                    
                   <li> Created Delete function in website and problem when 2 users try to delete the same function at the same time causing the first user’s screen to stop loading. </li>
                    
                    Learned how to use GIT repository for saving code
                    
                   <li> Agile software is used in oder for multiple developers to code at the same time and in sprints.</li>

                    <ul></ul><strong>Reflections on what happened today (e.g. personal targets met / employability skills used / qualities and attributes required to be successful)</strong>
                    
                    <ul></ul>Communication and sharing thoughts and ideas along with learning how to use GIT repositories which will help me every time I do some coding.

                <li>9.45 - Standup meeting</li>
                    
                 <li>Organising tasks and todo lists using an application called Logseq.</li>
                    
                    <li>Testing in order that customers/users can’t delete pass through devices on the website.</li>
                    
                 <li>Agile Development can be used in real life projects (e.g NEA projects). Get a tiny bit of the entire product working and then test it in order to have something to work on/towards. This will also aid in making the necessary or desired changes earlier on.</li>
                    
                 <li>Testing with the deletion code commented, confirmed that the code was required as the webpage didn’t throw an error.</li>
                    
        
         
                 <ul></ul><strong> Reflections on what happened today (e.g. personal targets met / employability skills used / qualities and attributes required to be successful)</strong> </ul>
                    
                 <ul></ul>  The use of Logseq will help me with organising my work and also put into perspective how much work I’ve done and how much I have left using the checklist feature.

                    <li>9.45 - Standup meeting</li>
                    
                    <li>Some changes in the requirements of the story and the spec were required as there were missing parts in it. This was mandatory for the software to meet the requirements.</li>
                    
                    <li>Found a way around testing the delete instrument function from the front end before passing on the code from the developers to the testers.</li> 
                    
                    <li>Multilingual code so the translations for other languages were needed and provided below it even if it was just commented. E.g #____________</li>
                    
                    <li>Someone deleted the translations on previous code so we went to Github in order to find the PR number along with finding the pull request in ADO and this revealed who did it and why the translation was not required.
                    Updating his new code and testing if it works before it’s added to the main branch again.</li>
                   <ul></ul> <strong>Reflections on what happened today (e.g. personal targets met / employability skills used / qualities and attributes required to be successful) </strong>
                    
                <ul></ul>    IT is not like most things. More people ≠ faster work for the most part as different people will tactile solutions differently and when multiple people are working on the same code it can cause confusion and slows things down even more which is why the company has subsections and uses Agile development in sprints every 3 weeks.
